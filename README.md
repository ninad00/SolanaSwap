# 🪙 SolanaSwap

SolanaSwap is a decentralized token swapping platform built on the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com). It enables peer-to-peer swaps between two SPL tokens using custom smart contracts developed with [Anchor](https://book.anchor-lang.com/).

---

## ✨ Features

- Swap any two SPL tokens directly
- Permissionless: anyone can create or take offers
- Program Derived Address (PDA) based escrow
- Fully on-chain offer lifecycle (create, list, cancel, accept)
- React-based frontend with wallet integration

## ⚙️ How it Works

### 1. **Create Offer**
- A user (maker) deposits Token A into a PDA-controlled escrow.
- Metadata includes: Token A offered, Token B wanted, amounts, bump.

### 2. **Take Offer**
- A taker sends Token B to the maker.
- Program releases Token A from escrow to the taker.

### 3. **Cancel Offer**
- Maker can cancel an active offer, reclaiming their Token A.
